```
*Your text here*
```


## 4.Blockquote
To create blockquote, we can use the greater than sign `> `. We can create a single-line or multi-line blockquote. Also, blockquote inside a blockquote. We can add other text styles inside a blockquote, such as bold or italic text styles.

```
## 7. Code
We can also use triple backticks ``` before and after the code block to create the following view. We can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting. By mentioning the Programing language we can achieve the following view

``` C
printf("Enter your Number");
int a=scanf("%d",&a);

```

## 9. Link
We can create a link by the following way.
```
[title](https://www.sample.com)
```
## 10. Image
We can add images using the similar techniques we used for links. Also, we can use the HTML img tag to add an image. We can also embed GIF and SVG.
```
![alt text](sampleimage.jpg)
```
## 11. Tables
To create a table with headers we need to use dashes to separate each header cell and use pipes to separate columns. The outer pipes are optional.We can use any number of dashes and spaces to increase readability. We can use colons to align columns. 
- For left-align text, use a colon to the left of dashes. 
- For center-align text, use a colon on both sides of dashes. 
- For right-align text, use a colon to the right of dashes.
*By default Left align is used.*

| 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999   | 9999999999  |
